      desc: A simple, but elegant solution to sorting a list 

  analysis: "This feature is fairly straight forward, but I am concerned with stations being able to customize the text of each filter. I would guess that certain copy performs better than other copy, and that we shouldn't be afraid to tell stations that we know what works best, something that will benefit everybody, assuming that it's been thoroughly tested. This applies to whitelabelling in general, but will certainly need to be discussed in more detail."
