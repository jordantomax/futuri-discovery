      features:
        - Currently, stations can enable a pop-up entry form after X number of clicks in the widget.
        - Form has some text (possibly an image) describing a contest, and then any number of fields (usually 3-5 text fields i.e. name/email/phone)
        - This is not a heavily used feature, but those who do use it are making money with it through sponsorships.

  analysis: "It might be worth discussing how the contest modal is triggered. A user clicking 3 times and popping the modal seems somewhat arbitrary. Using Facebook's mixed content as an example again, it might be effective to add a row amidst the list of songs within instant requests. This could help to expose the feature and clarify how a user gets to it, while again helping to break up the flow"
