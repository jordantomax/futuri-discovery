        - Should be able to search for songs and suggest them if not found

  analysis: "Currently, this feature is exposed in search and the expanded view of a song. I recommend removing it from the expanded view of a song. My reasoning for this is that not all artists have 'other songs', and therefore do not have an expanded state. When there is no expanded state, there is no 'suggest a song', creating an arbitrarily inconsistent system. I would argue that if users don't see a song they're looking for under an artist, that searching for it is a logical next step, and isolating this feature to one place will help to streamline the feature."
