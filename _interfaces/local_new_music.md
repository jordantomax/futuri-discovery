  feature_sets:
    - name: Local Music Features
      features:
      - Users able to submit music through link to external form
      - Approved submissions are available for streaming in full and voting
      - OK to treat this like regular library music, with a flag for “Local”
      - Flag/filter text will be customizable by station, could be up to 20-30 characters (Negotiable - Maybe icons next to each song rather than text...but allow custom text for the filter option)
      - Allow hiding of alert if the submission is not going to be considered for airplay.

    - name: New Music Features
      features: 
        - PDs upload songs to Control Room (in full), users stream and vote (Negotiable - Maybe get rid of the full-length stream and just use Rovi clips, with a “New” flag/filter like we’re discussing for local music)
        - Flag new music automatically based on spin history (like we do for new music in our apps)

    - name: Featured Music Features
      features:
        - Stations can currently create additional request tabs for specific features (i.e. “Hair Cuts” for 80s metal songs or “Timberweek” during weeks when Justin Timberlake will be in town)
        - The widget is typically embedded with this “Featured” tab first, on a page dedicated to the feature.
        - If we go the flag/filter route for local/new music, do the same with this
        - Stations can have multiple featured music groups, need to be flexible
        
              
  services:
    - name: Facebook
      feature: Mixed Content
      img: facebook-mixed-content
      desc: Facebook adds various content types to their post stream, like this 'People You May Know' module. This technique is useful both visually and in terms of user engagement. A module that may have gotten little attention in another position might get much higher click through rates when associated with the content that a user is already consuming.


  analysis: "Similar to voting session, all 3 of these features mimics normal song requests. As per our previous discussion, I would advise moving them all into the request list with a small flag or icon to indicate the difference in content type. I would also recommend removing the play scrubber in favor of consistency with other songs.<br><br>
  
  The only new action in these screens is to submit local music for review. The above Facebook example is one way of elegantly exposing alternative content to users. The 'Upload Music' button could appear amongst the request list, which can help to break up the visual monotony of repeated content, as well as grab users attention. Of course, there can always be an action to dismiss it for users who are not musicians. Once dismissed, we can happily bury the feature knowing that it has at least been given its proper due.<br><br>
  
  It's going to be a little tricky providing functionality to add an unlimited number of featured music groups, each with a variable number of songs. The most obvious solution to this problem is to list them out like all other songs and to group them under a title. In this example, adding the option to 'x' out the group might help to let users get back to regular content quickly. Still, it feels a bit heavy handed. Another solution could be to put the group into a carousel that scrolls horizontally, which would help to reduce vertical space consumption. If we were to interject them psuedo randomly like the above facebook example, it might also help to mix up content."
