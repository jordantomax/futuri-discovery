        - User share on Facebook or Twitter

  analysis: "The number of Facebook shares is dire. A weekly sample of data shows that in 1,283,178 widget views, resulting in 124,785 song likes, there were only 233 Facebook shares. That's around 0.1% of song likes. Twitter shares are slightly more positive, coming it at 3618, or almost 3% of song likes. These numbers could be the result of stations not using the features, or the features not being visible enough. Either way, social sharing is not part of the core feature set of LDR1, and should be treated as such. If we are to adopt a hierarchical naviation, burying these controls behind a click would be highly advisable, assuming that we want to keep them at all.<br><br>
  
  Driving engagement with the module through social media is a powerful tactic, and should absolutely be used, but I would ask what the major goals of adding social media to the widget itself are."
