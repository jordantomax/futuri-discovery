    - name: Features
      features:
        - User share on Facebook or Twitter
        - See “More Info” from Rovi (exact info negotiable)
        - Buy link for Rovi

      feature: Navigation Hierarchy
      desc: A powerful method to remove clutter on individual screens is by creating hierarchically organized content. In this example, clicking a tile scrolls the screen right, and provides a back arrow in the top left to return to the full list of tiles.

      feature: Accordian
      desc: The accordian is an age old web paradigm that still has great value in its simpliciy. However, even when executed well as Tune Genie has, you face 2 main problems. If you are dealing with dynamic content inside of each result (as LDR1 is), the accordian will be varying height for each entry. Furthermore, you must deal with the somewhat jarring effect of content changing location when you click another entry to expand, closing the currently expanded entry.

  analysis: "Because there is so much meta content for each song (related songs, suggest a song, twitter info, facebook info, buy link, iHR link, etc.), I think that it is wise to bury the majority of this content behind a click similar to the current product. However, exposing this content with an accordian menu creates an experience that is overloaded with content and makes it difficult to focus on the content that you have just uncovered. Because the user has indicated an interest in this individual song or artist, I recommend giving them a view that removes all other data from the frame.<br><br> 

  Using a hierarchical structure similar to the new Google Material Design specs might be an effective way to do this. In this way, we can show a new page with a larger area for the artist/song in question with related content beneath. Another benefit of this is that we can easily expose new actions on this screen without creating too much clutter."
