      <h3>Analysis</h3>
      <p class="type-secondary no-mar-bottom">The most successful products simplify down to their core feature and make non core features less accessible. We have established that LDR1’s core features include upvoting and setting alerts, all else is secondary. <br><br>
Product Hunt's model of showing a single main call to action is worth exploring, though in our case we will need to mitigate having 2 primary call-to-actions. If we decide that these call-to-actions must be of equal prominence, it may be worth exploring Facebook's model of showing simple text links.<br><br>
Regardless of which features are surfaced, I recommend burying all secondary features behind a click that will bring the user one level deeper into a navigation structure. See <a href='#instant_request_expanded'>Instant Request Expanded</a> for details. Furthermore, as discussed, I recommend removing the 'Menu' construct entirely, and moving all relevant pages into the main Instant Requests page.<br><br>
I would recommend heavily against allowing users to mark songs to buy, or for any other reason. This feature is not part of the module's core feature set, and will add a level of complexity to each song row that will confuse the user experience.</p>

      <p class="type-secondary no-mar">The accordian is an age old web paradigm that still has great value in its simpliciy. However, even when executed well as Tune Genie has, you face 2 main problems. If you are dealing with dynamic content inside of each result (as LDR1 is), the accordian will be varying height for each entry. Furthermore, you must deal with the somewhat jarring effect of content changing location when you click another entry to expand, closing the currently expanded entry.</p>

    <div class="mod-interface-section">
      <h3>Analysis</h3>
      <p class="type-secondary no-mar-bottom">Because there is so much meta content for each song (related songs, suggest a song, twitter info, facebook info, buy link, iHR link, etc.), I think that it is wise to bury the majority of this content behind a click similar to the current product. However, exposing this content with an accordian menu creates an experience that is overloading with content and makes it difficult to focus on the content that you have just uncovered. Because the user has indicated an interest in this individual song or artist, I recommend giving them a view that removes all other data from the frame.<br><br>
Using a hierarchical structure similar to the new Google Material Design specs might be an effective way to do this. In this way, we can show a new page with a larger area for the artist/song in question with related content beneath. Another benefit of this is that we can easily expose new actions on this screen without creating too much clutter.</p>

    <div class="mod-interface-section">
      <h3>Analysis</h3>
      <p class="type-secondary no-mar-bottom">There are as many as 4 clicks (and a field entry for new users) to set up a new alert. The main reason for this is that each song has global and local options associated with it. Even if the user doesn't want to change anything, they still see each of these options every time they want to set an alert<br><br>
To elaborate, selecting sms, email, or twitter is something that a user will only ever want to do once. It should apply to all alerts that are set. It would be surprising for a user to want to receive a text alert when Jason Derulo comes on, and a Twitter alert when Sam Smith comes on. Similarly, the 'Phone, Email, or Handle' input is global. <br><br>
The only setting that is local is 'How many times?', which we unfortunately don't have enough data about to make a very informed decision.  In an ideal world, alerts could be turned on and off by clicking an icon or text on a song's row, which would then show an active/inactive state. Turning on an alert should not require the user to see a modal. If it were the user's first time setting an alert, we would show alert settings similar to what is done right now.<br><br>
If it is necessary to be able to change the number of alerts that a user wants per song, perhaps we could expose this option more seamlessly when the user clicks to be alerted. The user clicks once, we show an active state and the text '1x'. They click again, we change the text to read '3x'. They click again, we show 'every time'. One more time, and we disable the alert. In this way, we reduce the visual friction on each song row to an absolute minimum, and only surface relevant content when the user decides to interact with it.<br><br>
Before we do make a decision about how to handle the number of times though, It would be helpful to have more data about why this feature exists as it does. I wonder if it would be possible to reduce all alerts down to 1x alerts to create a simpler and more consistent interface. It would also help to drive traffic to the radio station by requiring them to come back and interact with the widget. It is hard for users to think beyond their immediate choices, and it's best to ask them questions only when they are relevant. Asking a user to think 3x into the future is a mental strain on that user. Instead, when we send an alert, we could give an option to reply in order to reset it. This would force the user to interact and also create a simplified interface. </p>

      <p class="type-secondary no-mar">Polar is an app that focuses only on voting. Regardless of where we put voting (it sounds like everyone is in favor of moving it to the main instant requests screen), it might be worth investigating a more focused/visually rich solution such as this, which could also help to differentiate voting from your standard request list.</p>

      <h3>Analysis</h3>
      <p class="type-secondary no-mar-bottom">The current implementation for voting takes the user away from the normal request list to a screen that often has as few as 3 songs to vote on, in which case we are left with excessive white space. Once they have voted, they have to manually switch back to the instant requests tab, which they likely will not do. Furthermore, the content within the voting tab is similar to requests both visually and in terms of content. To alleviate these problems, I recommend moving the voting tab into the request list and promoting it to the top<br><br>
In promoting voting to the top of the requests list, we uncomplicate the user experience, prevent there from ever being a null state, and avoid visual emptiness. As noted above with Polar, it might be worth exploring an option that differentiates voting from normal song requests. Because there is only 1 call-to-action associated with voting, it seems a prime target for a visually rich and uncomplicated implementation. In addition, it would help to distinguish the purpose of voting from requesting, something which is essential if we are to merge the features. </p>

      <h3>Analysis</h3>
      <p class="type-secondary no-mar-bottom">Similar to voting session, all 3 of these features mimics normal song requests. As per our previous discussion, I would advise moving them all into the request list with a small flag to indicate the difference in content type. I would also recommend removing the play scrubber in favor of consistency with other songs.<br><br>
The only new action in these screens is to submit local music for review. The above Facebook example is one way of elegantly exposing alternative content to users. The 'Upload Music' button could appear amongst the request list, which can help to break up the visual monotony of repeated content, as well as grab users attention. Of course, there can always be an action to dismiss it for users who are not musicians. Once dismissed, we can happily bury the feature knowing that it has at least been given its proper due.<br><br>
It's going to be a little tricky providing functionality to add an unlimited number of featured music groups, each with a variable number of songs. The most obvious solution to this problem is to list them out like all other songs and to group them under a title. In this example, adding the option to 'x' out the group might help to let users get back to regular content quickly. Still, it feels a bit heavy handed. Another solution could be to put the group into a carousel that scrolls horizontally, which would help to reduce vertical space consumption. If we were to interject them psuedo randomly like the above facebook example, it might also help to mix up content.</p>

      <p class="type-secondary no-mar-bottom">This feature is somewhat unrelated to the core features of LDR1. It is an unactionable piece of content with no relationship to voting or setting alerts. Still, I acknowledge that it makes the module feel more tied to the content around it. If we are to keep this feature, it seems logical that we should try to integrate it more seamlessly with the other LDR1 features. Removing the visual separation between now playing and the instant requests list would help to accomplish this. Increasing the size of now playing would also help to give the top of the module some weight and distinction. Tune Genie does a great job of displaying relevant information for now playing and recently played. They provide a visually richer experience by including album art and other meta data.<br><br>
If we are going to show now playing information, a logical next step is to also display recently played. Somehow, the features feel incomplete without one another. One way to accomplish this would be to use the same hierarchical navigation structure from our expanded instant requests illustrated in the Google Navigation Structure above. We could place a 'recently played' text link in the Now Playing song. When clicked, it would scroll the user right to a list of songs, which would be styled the same as our other instant request songs. These songs would also have the same actions as other instant request songs and an additional timestamp.</p>

When there is no expanded state, there is no 'suggest a song', creating an arbitrarily inconsistent system. I would argue that if users don't see a song they're looking for under an artist, that searching for it is a logical next step, and isolating this feature to one place will help to streamline the feature.</p>

Twitter shares are slightly more positive, coming it at 3618, or almost 3% of song likes. These numbers could be the result of stations not using the features, or the features not being visible enough. Either way, social sharing is not part of the core feature set of LDR1, and should be treated as such. If we are to adopt a hierarchical naviation, burying these controls behind a click would be highly advisable, assuming that we want to keep them at all.<br><br>
Driving engagement with the module through social media is a powerful tactic, and should absolutely be used, but I would ask what the major goals of adding social media to the widget itself are.</p>
